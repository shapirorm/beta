# Testing Grounds for a State of the Art Warp Engine Navigation System

## Introduction

We introduce an early beta version of our Warp Engine Navigation System 
(WENS). WENS works alongside the Worm Hole Engine Drive (WOED). WENS 
calculates entry and exit worm hole points and worm hole boundaries, in 
real-time, and allows starships to navigate within the worm hole without 
standard navigational environments to guide them (e.g., the stellar maps).

WENS is written in the ![Basic Programming 
Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC), and will be available for 
purchase in April 2247.

If you would like to test the system, please contact Warp Technologies, Inc.
